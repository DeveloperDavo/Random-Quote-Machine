# Random Quote Machine
This is a simple webpage that generates random quotes that can be shared on Twitter. The requirements for this project can be found at [freeCodeCamp]("https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine"). I completed this project so I could consolidate what I learnt in [Head First JavaScript Programming](http://www.wickedlysmart.com/hfjs/).

I'll wait until I get a bit better at design ;).
